Programming Activity 1
Write a program which can tell if a 3 digit number is a palindrome. 
 - Create a variable, which stores user input. Prompt the user to enter a 3 digit number. 
 - Convert the user input into a integer (int). To get the first digit alone, floor division by 100. 
 - To get the 3rd digit alone, modulus by 10. 
 - Check if the first digit and 3rd digit are the same. 
 - If they are the same print("palindrome!!!!"). 
 - Else print("not palindrome!")

Programming Activity 2
Write a program which can add up the numbers in the series:

Programming Activity 3
Write a program which determines whether a child can sit in the front seat  of a car, using the following logic:
- if a child is 12 years old or older, they can sit in the front, regardless of weight.
- if a child is 11 years old, and over 90 pounds, they can sit in the front seat.
- if a child is under 11 years old, and over 100 pounds, they can sit in the front seat
- if a child does meet the criteria above they cannot sit in the front seat.
Your program will ask the user for a child's age and weight. Use Boolean variables to store the results of the criteria above. Use if statements and the Boolean variables created above to print a message to the user whether or not the child may sit in the front seat.

"""
Programming Activity 4
Write a function named "welcome_fctn" which takes one argument, called "name".  Inside the function, print to the console "Welcome " name.
- Use the def command to define a function "welcome_fctn"
- Add a parameter list with one variable "name", i.e. (name)
- Print "Welcome " name in the function body.
- We don't need a return statement here, but keep in mind python does return nothing.
- Call the function, welcome_fctn(<your_name>)

"""
Programming Activity 5
Update the function in activity one, and create a new string variable in the function called, welcome_message. The variable welcome_message should be 
assigned the value "Welcome " name. The same value printed in activity 1, but here you save it as a variable. Return the variable welcome_message.
- Assuming your function in programming activity 1 works, you will need to:
- Create a variable to store "Welcome " + name
- Return the value welcome_message
- There are a couple ways to test this. you could
         1. Print(welcome_fctn("Bob"))
         2. Create a variable to store what is returned by the function then print that

Programming Activity 6
Update the function in activity one to have 3 variables: name (string),  age (int), favorite_color (string).  Create a new variable called 
welcome_message and assign it to the value "Welcome <name>, you are <age> years old, and <favorite_color> is your favorite color".  
Return the variable welcome_message.
- Add two variables to your parameter list
- Concatenate those two variables in your welcome_message
- Return welcome_message just like you did in activity 2
- To test this, call welcome_fctn with 3 arguments
